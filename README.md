# Tableau Public

This is a simple module that pulls in Tableau visualizations that are hosted on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/).

This module lives in two places:

- Drupal.org: https://www.drupal.org/project/tableau_public
- Github: https://github.com/Exygy/tableau_public

We will respond to issues reported in both locations.

## Related modules:

- [Tableau module](https://www.drupal.org/project/tableau): Pull in visualizations & other objects from a stand-alone Tableau server
  - *How this module is different:* Tableau Public only pulls visualizations from the Tableau Public cloud server.  The Tableau module only pulls from stand-alone Tableau servers, *not* Tableau Public.
- [Tableau dashboard module](https://www.drupal.org/project/tableau_dashboard): Pulls in Tableau dashboards only.
  - *How this module is different:* Tableau Public pulls in sheets, not dashboards, and presents custom buttons to switch between sheets.  The dashboard module simply presents dashboards as-is. 
  
# Installation

You can install this as a normal Drupal module from Drupal.org, using Drush, or Composer.  You can also pull directly from the public Github repository.  The project will be maintained in both places with the latest version.
